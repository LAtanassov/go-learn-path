# Go Learn Path

This repository should guide you the way from the installation of Go till advanced topic like memory management and Go routine scheduler and provide you links to public material.

## Start with the Basics (approx. 1 week)

Lets start with [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/) and learning the basics.  
A must have here are 
* [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
* [How to write Go code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)
* [Editor plugins and IDEs](https://golang.org/doc/editors.html)
* [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

Understand the core ideas behind Go
* [dotGo 2015 - Rob Pike - Simplicity is Complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM)
* [Go Proverbs - Rob Pike - Gopherfest - November 18, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c)
* [Rob Pike - 'Concurrency Is Not Parallelism'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso)

Now that you know the basic about Go, it is time to get your hands dirty by writing simple algorithm. Pick some challenge from [https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) and writing Go. Focus on Test Driven Development using the standard Go testing package [https://golang.org/pkg/testing/](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/).

You should now be able to write unit/integration/ benchmark test cases, simple function, structs and got familiar with Go Idiomatic.
